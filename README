Bendy Bus
=========

Bendy Bus is a system to mock up parts of D-Bus serverâ€“client systems in order to test the other parts.

It allows fuzz and unit testing of D-Bus clients by simulating the corresponding D-Bus servers.
Simulations are written in a simple FSM-based language.

The user manual is available online at http://tecnocode.co.uk/bendy-bus/manual/, or can be compiled using
	cd bendy-bus/docs/manual
	make xhtml
if yelp-tools are installed.
