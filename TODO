Bendy Bus TODO
==============

Nice to have:
 • Add variable length delays before replies/errors/emissions to allow interleaving of replies & arbitrary transitions
 • Automake integration

 • Better dict fuzzing
 • Verify bendy-bus with Klee
 • Split up random number generators to lessen the impact of code changes

Future:
 • Inclusions
 • Split test utility up into simulator and controller, separated by a D-Bus control interface
 • GtkSourceView highlighter
 • Support creating new objects by a pattern
