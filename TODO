Bendy Bus TODO
==============

Nice to have:
 • Add variable length delays before replies/errors/emissions to allow interleaving of replies & arbitrary transitions
 • Automake integration
 • GObject introspection for libdfsm, especially so it can be used from Python
 • Default implementations for D-Bus methods automatically generated from introspection XML, which just spew (correctly typed) fuzzy data

 • Better dict fuzzing
 • Verify bendy-bus with Klee
 • Split up random number generators to lessen the impact of code changes

Future:
 • Inclusions (allowing re-use of code between simulation descriptions)
 • Split test utility up into simulator and controller, separated by a D-Bus control interface
 • GtkSourceView highlighter
 • Support creating new objects by a pattern
 • Support the D-Bus ObjectManager pattern natively
 • Allow explicit annotation of preferred transition paths in simulation descriptions
 • Model checking of client behaviour by annotating transitions with whether they're expected in a given server state
 • UI fuzzing of clients
