<title>Simulation Language</title>

<p>The simulation language used by Bendy Bus is block structured, and makes use of small basic blocks (sequences of statements) arranged into larger
blocks representing D-Bus objects. The type system in the simulation language is equivalent to the D-Bus type system, and its syntax mirrors the
<link href="http://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/gvariant-text.html">GVariant</link> text format, which is itself based on Python syntax. The syntax for
the rest of the language loosely follows C â€” so, for example, comments are delimited by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.</p>
